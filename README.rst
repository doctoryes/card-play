Plays cards.

Design Notes
============
- Classic game scenario
    - Who will connect to whom?
    - Will all game players connect to the dealer server?
    - Will all game players connect to each other?
    - Who holds the truth? Who can be trusted?
    - Who's the arbiter of which clients plays with which other clients?
    - How is a game started? Is rule negotiation supported?
    - Is there a separate lobby server and game server?
- Protocol
    - There must be a confirmation of dealt cards!
